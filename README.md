### Planet Collector Game Overview

### About
This program is a play off of the ever popular Crystal Collector Game with a bit more style, flare, and dimension. In this assignment, I've created a fun and interactive game for web browsers utilizing jQuery, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. This app runs in the web browser and dynamically updates the HTML pages from the jQuery libary from within JavaScript. 

### Objective
1. This games provides users a random number between 19-120 at the start of the game. 
2. There are four planets to click that will add a specific random amount of points to their total score. 
3. A user wins the game by matching their total score to the random number. 
4. The user loses the game if their total score exceeds the random number. 
5. The game alerts the user if they've won or lost then updates the scoreboard and automatically resets the game.

[NOTE] - The value of each planet is hidden from the user until the planet is clicked. Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each planet between 1-12 and select a new target number.
